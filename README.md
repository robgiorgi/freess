To write a program, students simply replace each mnemonic with its corresponding opcode, specify the register indices, and provide any required immediate values. The handling of branch instructions is particularly instructive: instead of using labels as in assembly, students must enter the immediate value representing the number of instructions to jumpâ€”positive for forward branches, negative for backward ones, effectively replacing the role of labels in `BEQ` and `BNE` instructions. For those unfamiliar with machine code, this exercise also provides a valuable opportunity to understand how binary files encode programs at the instruction level.

Table 1 reports the opcodes for the seven supported instructions.

**Table 1: FREESS instructions**

| Mnemonic | Operation Code (opcode) |
|----------|-------------------------|
| ADD      | 1                       |
| ADDI     | 2                       |
| LW       | 3                       |
| SW       | 4                       |
| BEQ      | 5                       |
| BNE      | 6                       |
| MUL      | 7                       |

Assuming the code:
`
loop: x3 <- mem(0+x4)   # load b(i)
      x7 <- mem(128+x5) # load c(i)
      x7 <- x7 * x3     # b(i) * c(i)
      x1 <- x1 - 1      # decr. counter
      mem(256+x6)<- x7  # store a(i)
      x2 <- x2 + 8      # bump index
      P <- loop; x1!=0  # close loop
`
the resulting code is the following (i.e., filename 'program1':

`
1 3 4 0
1 7 5 128
7 7 7 3
6 1 1 -1
2 7 6 256
6 2 2 8
4 1 0 -7
`

# running the program:
`
./freess -exe program1
`

# for help
`
./freess -h
`
